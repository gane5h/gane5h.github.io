Hey there, I’m Ganesh Swami.

I’m an entrepreneur, speaker and adventurer living in Vancouver, BC.

Since I was a little kid, I've had an intense desire to bring something new to
the world. Over the last few years, I've been fortunate to be a part of building
the future, either as an early employee or as a founder.

Professionally, I've been trained as an engineer and have been writing code
since I was 15. Through my career working on multiple startups, I've become an
expert with the entire lifecycle of data – data collection, data storage, data
analysis and data visualization. Data has inertia and is here to stay forever.

I'm interested in all aspects of venture building: product and engineering,
recruiting, fundraising, customer success, marketing and sales. I only have
experience with software subscription business models and I've written and
spoken a lot on the topic. 

My latest venture is Covalent, a venture funded startup attempting to solve the
huge problems inhibiting blockchain adoption. Our first product has indexed
entire blockchains and can be used to match cryptocurrency utility and adoption
to exchange prices on the market. 

My other venture is Silota, a portmanteau of the words SILO and DATA. It's a
pro-tool for data analysts and is intended for visualizing big data. You can use
Silota to understand your business operations, for example billing, sales,
marketing, and customer success.

On a personal level, I like cooking, traveling, and practicing spirituality. I
intend to have sections on this website for these topics in the future. I live
with my beautiful wife in Gastown.

This little corner of the web is where I journal my highs and lows – STRAIGHT
OUTTA GASTOWN. 

 
MUCH LOVE,
